  <h1>Privacy Policy — Qırım Online</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> October 14, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We collect only the data necessary to operate the service, store it securely, and provide you with control over your personal data — including the ability to delete your account via the website or by emailing <a href="mailto:contact@qirim.online">contact@qirim.online</a>.</p>

  <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
  <p>Qırım Online (the “Service”, “we”, “us”, “our”) provides a web interface for accessing a music catalog and related features (including karaoke). For privacy questions or requests, contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@qirim.online">contact@qirim.online</a>.</p>

  <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Registration data:</strong> email address, username, and a hashed password (we never store your password in plain text).</li>
    <li><strong>Profile data:</strong> display name, avatar (if uploaded), profile settings or preferences.</li>
    <li><strong>OAuth data:</strong> when you sign in with Google/Apple/etc., we receive the provider identifier and email (as permitted by the provider & your consent).</li>
    <li><strong>Content you add:</strong> playlists and user-contributed karaoke songs (YouTube links), and metadata such as title and artist.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical and log data:</strong> IP addresses, browser user agent, request timestamps, and server logs for diagnostics and security.</li>
    <li><strong>Cookies and tracking:</strong> cookies and analytics data to enable the app and measure usage (see Section 6).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How we use your data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To operate and maintain accounts and features (authentication, storing playlists and settings).</li>
    <li>To process OAuth sign-ins and account creation.</li>
    <li>For security and fraud prevention.</li>
    <li>To improve the Service through analytics and troubleshooting.</li>
    <li>To handle support requests, including account deletion requests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Legal bases for processing</h2>
  <p>Where applicable, we process personal data on the following bases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Performance of a contract (providing the Service).</li>
    <li>Legal obligations (if required).</li>
    <li>Legitimate interests (security, fraud prevention, and service improvement).</li>
    <li>Consent (for certain cookies or analytics where applicable).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Sharing data with third parties</h2>
  <p>We may share data with infrastructure and hosting providers, OAuth providers (only what you consent to share), analytics services, and when required by law. If you add a YouTube link, the video content itself remains hosted by YouTube; we store only the link and metadata.</p>

  <h2>6. Cookies and tracking technologies</h2>
  <p>We use cookies and local storage for sessions, authentication, and UI preferences. Optional analytics may be used with consent. You can disable cookies in your browser, but some Service features may stop working properly.</p>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>
  <p>We implement industry-standard measures to protect personal data (TLS, access controls, backups). If a breach occurs we will notify affected users as required by law.</p>

  <h2>8. Data retention and deletion</h2>
  <p>Accounts and related personal data are retained until you request deletion or we must retain data for legal reasons. After a deletion request, the account is deactivated and deletion begins; backups and logs may persist for a limited time and will be purged in due course. We may retain anonymized data for analytics.</p>

  <h2>9. Your rights</h2>
  <p>You may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict, or port your personal data. To exercise these rights, contact <a href="mailto:contact@qirim.online">contact@qirim.online</a>.</p>

  <h2>10. How to delete your account</h2>
  <p>You can delete your account in two ways: through the website or by email.</p>
  <p><strong>Option A — Delete via the website</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Log in to your account.</li>
    <li>Go to Settings → Account (or Profile).</li>
    <li>Click “Delete account” and confirm. Your account will be deactivated and deletion will begin.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Option B — Email request</strong></p>
